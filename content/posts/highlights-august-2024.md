So this one was a long time in the making. Honestly, posting these just faded away in the nexus of things you need to handle every day. But coming back here and reading previous highlights made me realize this is a worthwile thing to do. I will try to post these highlights more regularly.


- Training BJJ with my old friend Elias, who came visiting from the US
- Fixed my bike and now cycling everywhere (I almost forgot how amazing biking is)
- celebrating one year at Deepl ðŸš€
